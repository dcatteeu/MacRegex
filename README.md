# MacRegex #

MacRegex is a regular expression tester that automatically shows the current contents of the clipboard and highlights all text that matches your regular expression.

There are many slightly different syntaxes for regular expressions. MacRegex v0.9 supports ICU's syntax. It is described at [http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp](http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp). The same syntax is used by Objective-C and Swift.
