== v1 ==

This should be a minimally functional, but finished, regular expression tester.

* BUG: What if there is no utf8string on the pasteboard, but for example an image? What if there is more than one item on the pasteboard?

* Fill out the About dialog.

* Add some help. Just saying the syntax is that of Objective-C and a link to ICU (see Apple's docs).



== v2 ==

* Multiple syntaxes

May want to use following library for multiple regex syntaxes: https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo. It is derived from the library used by reggyapp.com.



== Feature pool ==

* Back and forth buttons to cycle between matches

* Option to switch between monitoring the pasteboard and monitoring a file; user can chose a file

* option to find&replace

There are 2 textview, 1 that shows the original file with highlighted matches and one that shows the result after replacement. The results are also highlighted and the view are synchronized.

* Option to switch between case sensitive and case insensitive.

* Let the user build a library of regular expressions. Provide some popular examples (email, IP, or MAC address)

* Dynamically highlight matches. Whenever the user stops typing for a long enough time (100ms) update the matches.

* Let the user copy&paste his regular expression. Can this be done without changing the contents of the text view?

* Let the user export, or see, his regular expression in another syntax.

* A menu entry to contact the developer.

* An extensive help document on regular expressions that can be put  next to the main window.

* Show the list of matches.
